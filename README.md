# MNIST Demonstration
This webapp lets a user write an arabic digit (0-9) on an HTML Canvas and a Keras model determines and displays which digit the user wrote. It can be access at this link: http://mnist-cs485.herokuapp.com/


This webapp was inspired by this Medium post: https://towardsdatascience.com/deploying-a-simple-machine-learning-model-into-a-webapp-using-tensorflow-js-3609c297fb04

I didn't come up with any of the tensorflow.js or other javascript in this webapp, but followed the Medium tutorial to a T, and edited the HTML and CSS formatting to more appropriately fit my tastes.

I trained my MNIST model using the architecture outlined in Franic Challet's textbook, "Deep Learning with Python"
